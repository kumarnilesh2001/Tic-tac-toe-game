## Description

This project is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players can take turns to play. The game is built using JavaScript for the game logic, HTML for the structure, and CSS for styling.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to mark a square on the grid.
   - Player 1 is "X"
   - Player 2 is "O"
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all nine squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is considered a draw.

## Features

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Click on the grid to make your move.
- **Turn Indicator**: The game automatically switches between "X" and "O" after each move.
- **Win Detection**: The game detects and announces the winner as soon as a player wins.
